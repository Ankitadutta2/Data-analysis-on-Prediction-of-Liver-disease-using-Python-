# Data-analysis-on-Prediction-of-Liver-disease-using-Python
This dataset contains 416 liver patient records and 167 non liver patient records of India which includes records of Age of the patient,Gender of the patient,Total Bilirubin,Direct Bilirubin,Alkaline Phosphotase,Alamine Aminotransferase,Aspartate Aminotransferase,Total Protiens,Albumin,Albumin and Globulin Ratio and Dataset: field used to split the data into two sets (patient with liver disease, or no disease)
In this project I performed
1) preprocessing of data which includes addressing missing values,feature scaling, handling categorical variables etc.
2) exploration of data using various statistical function
3)finding the corelation using random forest, naive bayes and logistic regression
4)evaluating and comparing each model for the prediction of liver disease
